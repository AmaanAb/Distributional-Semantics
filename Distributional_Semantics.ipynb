    "In this assignment we will use distributional semantics to investigate how some words in the English language changed over the course of the last two centuries. To do so, we will use two sections from the **Corpus of Historical American English (COHA)** - one with texts written between 1800 and 1840, and a contemporary one with texts written between 2000 and 2010. \n",
    "\n",
    "In distributional semantics, we use the context of a word to represent its meaning. In the first part of this assignment we will use simple bi-gram statistics to get a first feel for how words' co-occurrences can reflect their meaning, then move to two more refined sampling methods called **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)** and **SkipGram** which frequently used in developing distributional semantics models, and finally train a full **Word2Vec model** on the two corpora and investigate how certain words have developed over time by comparing their representations.\n",

    "## Q1.2 Extracting co-occurrence counts (5 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a word co-occurrence matrix directly can cause memory usage problems: the target/context word matrix can have of the order of 100,000 rows and columns (the size of the observed vocabulary). One way to get round this is to use sparse matrices, which are memory- and computation-efficient - but they can be a bit complicated to work with if you're not used to them. Here, we will take a different approach: we'll use the existing CountVectorizer class to do the work for us (it uses sparse matrix libraries underneath). This means doing something slightly different from the standard approach described in lectures: instead of basing our co-occurrence counts on a sliding fixed-width window, we will be basing them on co-occurrence of words within the same sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, utilise the CountVectorizer class to transform the input text into a square, symmetric matrix with a zero diagonal, in which the entries are co-occurrence counts. See the comments below for more detail on how to achieve this.\n",

    "Co-occurrence count vectors are a bit limited in how well they model word meaning and change, and it's more usual to use more advanced word-vectorization methods like Word2Vec. Word2Vec can use two different methods to specify or sample a target word's context: the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and SkipGram models. In this part, you'll be tasked to implement these two approaches to understand how they sample and represent word co-occurrence in context.\n",

    "With CBOW, we use the left and right context of a target word to try to predict the target. To create training data for CBOW, we therefore have to create sliding context windows that collect a given number of previous and following words as context, and link those contexts to the targets. For this assignment, we'll use a window size of 2, so we'll look at the two words before and the two words after a word in the corpus and consider that to be its context. You do not need to add padding, but should skip words that don't have enough words to the left or to the right to fill the full context window.\n",

    "As an example, processing the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\" should yield the following output:\n",

    "```\n",
    "The first part of each tuple is the context, which in our case is 4 words (2 left and 2 right), and the second entry is the target (which should go in the middle of the context). \n",

    "With SkipGrams, we go the other way round: given a word, we want to predict its context. However, this is quite heavy on training, so we simplify the task a little: Given two words, determine whether they are neighbours (whithin the range of the window size) in the corpus. For this assignment, we'll again use a window size of 2, so we'll look at the two words before and the two words after a word in the corpus and consider that to be its context. You do not need to add padding, but should skip words that don't have enough words to the left or to the right to fill the full context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of adding the full context as training instance, in this case we create triplets containing the target, one of its context words, and a binary indicator to show that they are neighbours. So processing the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\" should yield samples like\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[('brown', 'The', 1),\n",
    " ('brown', 'quick', 1),\n",
    " ('brown', 'fox', 1),\n",
    " ('brown', 'jumped', 1),\n",
    " ('fox', 'quick', 1),\n",
    " ('fox', 'brown', 1),\n",
    " ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Besides adding these positive samples, we can further speed up training by adding negative samples. To create negative samples, we simply pick a number of random words from the corpus and asssign them a negative binary flag, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "('brown', 'timer', 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "For this assignment, we'll add the same number of negative samples as positive ones for each target, so there should be a total of 8 entries for each target word in the corpus. To make the negative samples more helpful, we also only want to use random words that appear at least 10 times in the corpus. You can again use the CountVectorizer to build this vocabulary.\n"
